The feature of your application that contributed most to the classifier's decision was your 
\textbf{ {{ feats_by_contrib[0]}} }of {{feature_vals[feats_by_contrib[0]]}}. It was assigned a contribution score of {{ attributions[feats_by_contrib[0]] | round}} \%. {% if num_feats != 1 %} The 
next {{num_feats - 1}} most contributing features in order of importance are:
{% for i in range(1, num_feats) %}
The {{ordinals[i+1]}} most contributing feature  of your application was your \textbf{ {{feats_by_contrib[i]}} } of {{feature_vals[feats_by_contrib[i]]}}. 
It was assigned a contribution score of {{attributions[feats_by_contrib[i]] | round}} \%.
