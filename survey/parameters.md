# Parameters for survey data genearion

All survey questions were generated for the data instance with index 62 in the original dataset (feature values for this instance can be found 
in the data_instance subdirectory).

*NOTE: At the time of writing Dice-ML does not support deterministic generation of counterfactual examples, hence the generation of these cannot be reliably reproduced.*
